# MCP API

A scalable HTTP API for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with secure secret management.

## Overview

MCP API addresses a critical limitation in the current MCP server ecosystem: most MCP servers are designed for single-user usage, with secrets (API keys, passwords) stored directly in environment variables. This project enhances security and scalability by:

1. Exposing MCP servers via a unified HTTP API
2. Abstracting secret handling through secure encryption
3. Supporting multi-user access to the same MCP server instances
4. Providing package management for easy installation and configuration of MCP servers

Instead of embedding sensitive credentials in environment variables, MCP API stores them encrypted in MongoDB and retrieves/decrypts them as needed for specific tool operations.

## Features

- **Multi-user Support**: Multiple users can access the same MCP server instances with their own credentials
- **Secure Secret Management**: All sensitive information is stored encrypted in MongoDB
- **User-specific Secret Storage**: Each user's secrets are isolated and encrypted separately
- **Package Management**: Simplified installation and configuration of MCP server packages
- **HTTP API**: Simple REST API for accessing MCP tools and managing secrets
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose support for easy deployment

## Architecture

MCP API acts as a proxy between clients and MCP servers:

1. **Client Requests**: Applications send requests to the HTTP API
2. **Secret Management**: The API retrieves and decrypts user-specific secrets as needed
3. **Package Management**: The API handles installation, configuration, and lifecycle of MCP server packages
4. **MCP Server Communication**: The API communicates with MCP servers using the Model Context Protocol
5. **Response Handling**: Results from MCP servers are returned to clients

The system uses AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored secrets, with a separate encryption key for each deployment.

            },
            "required": ["param1"]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The response structure contains:

- `success`: Boolean indicating if the request was successful
- `tools`: An array of objects, each containing a server name as the key and an array of tool definitions as the value
  - Each tool definition includes:
    - `name`: The name of the tool (used when calling the tool)
    - `description`: A human-readable description of the tool's functionality
    - `inputSchema`: A JSON Schema object defining the expected parameters for the tool
      - `properties`: Defines the parameters the tool accepts
      - `required`: An array of parameter names that are required

This endpoint is useful for discovering what tools are available and understanding their input requirements before making tool calls.

#### Call an MCP Tool

```
POST /mcp/tool/call
```

Executes a tool on a specified MCP server with the provided arguments.

Request body:

```json
{
  "username": "user123", // Optional, defaults to "default"
  "serverName": "mcp-github",
  "methodName": "create_issue",
  "args": {
    "owner": "username",
    "repo": "repo-name",
    "title": "Issue title",
    "body": "Issue description"
  }
}
```

Parameters:

- `username`: (Optional) The username to use for retrieving secrets. Defaults to "default" if not provided.
- `serverName`: (Required) The name of the MCP server that provides the tool.
- `methodName`: (Required) The name of the tool to call.
- `args`: (Required) An object containing the arguments to pass to the tool.

Response format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "content": "Tool execution result",
    "contentType": "text/plain"
  }
}
```

The response structure contains:

- `success`: Boolean indicating if the request was successful
- `data`: The result of the tool execution
  - `content`: The actual result data (can be a string, object, or array)
  - `contentType`: The MIME type of the content (e.g., "text/plain", "application/json")

Error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

##### Secret Handling

A key feature of the `/mcp/tool/call` endpoint is automatic secret injection:

1. When a tool call is made, the system automatically retrieves any stored secrets for the specified username and server
2. These secrets are merged with the provided arguments before the tool is called
3. This means sensitive information like API keys or passwords don't need to be included in the request payload

For example, if you've previously stored a GitHub token using the `/secrets/set` endpoint:

```json
{
  "username": "user123",
  "serverName": "mcp-github",
  "secretName": "GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "secretValue": "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Then when calling a GitHub tool, you don't need to include the token in your request:

```json
{
  "username": "user123",
  "serverName": "mcp-github",
  "methodName": "create_issue",
  "args": {
    "owner": "username",
    "repo": "repo-name",
    "title": "Issue title",
    "body": "Issue description"
  }
}
```

The system will automatically inject the `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the arguments before calling the tool.

This approach provides several benefits:

- Clients don't need to manage or expose sensitive credentials in their requests
- Each user can have their own set of secrets for the same MCP servers
- Secrets are stored securely (encrypted) and only decrypted when needed

#### List Available MCP Servers

```
GET /mcp/servers
```

Returns a list of all registered MCP servers with their configuration and status information.

### Secret Management

#### Set a Secret

```
POST /secrets/set
```

Stores a secret value for a specific user and MCP server. The secret is encrypted before being stored in the database.

Request body:

```json
{
  "username": "user123", // Optional, defaults to "default"
  "serverName": "mcp-github",
  "secretName": "GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "secretValue": "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Parameters:

- `username`: (Optional) The username to associate the secret with. Defaults to "default" if not provided.
- `serverName`: (Required) The name of the MCP server that will use this secret.
- `secretName`: (Required) The name of the secret (e.g., "API_KEY", "PASSWORD").
- `secretValue`: (Required) The actual secret value to store.

Response format:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

When a secret is set:

1. The system checks if the specified server exists
2. The secret value is encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption
3. The encrypted secret is stored in the database, associated with the specified username and server
4. If a secret with the same name already exists for this user and server, it is overwritten

Secrets set with this endpoint are automatically injected into tool calls made with the `/mcp/tool/call` endpoint when the same username and server name are specified.

#### Delete a Secret

```
POST /secrets/delete
```

Removes a stored secret for a specific user and MCP server.

Request body:

```json
{
  "username": "user123", // Optional, defaults to "default"
  "serverName": "mcp-github",
  "secretName": "GITHUB_TOKEN"
}
```

Parameters:

- `username`: (Optional) The username associated with the secret. Defaults to "default" if not provided.
- `serverName`: (Required) The name of the MCP server the secret is associated with.
- `secretName`: (Required) The name of the secret to delete.

Response format:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

When a secret is deleted:

1. The system locates the secret in the database based on the username, server name, and secret name
2. The secret is permanently removed from the database
3. Future tool calls will no longer have this secret automatically injected

#### Secret Security Model

The MCP API implements a robust security model for handling secrets:

1. **Encryption at Rest**: All secrets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before being stored in the database.
2. **User Isolation**: Each user's secrets are stored separately, allowing multiple users to use the same MCP servers with different credentials.
3. **Just-in-Time Decryption**: Secrets are only decrypted when needed for a specific tool call and are never stored in plaintext in memory for longer than necessary.
4. **Transparent Injection**: Secrets are automatically injected into tool calls, so clients don't need to handle or expose sensitive information in their requests.
5. **No Secret Enumeration**: There is no API endpoint to list all secrets, reducing the risk of information disclosure.

This approach allows for secure multi-user access to shared MCP server instances while maintaining strong isolation between users' credentials.

### OAuth2 Authentication Flow

For MCP servers that require user-specific OAuth2 authentication (like Google), the API provides a generic, secure, and scalable workflow. This allows users to grant consent once and enables the platform to perform actions on their behalf indefinitely, without the user or the front-end ever handling sensitive tokens.

**How It Works:**

The system uses a "declaration" pattern. An MCP server can declare its need for OAuth2 authentication via an environment variable in its configuration. The `mcp-api` host then orchestrates the flow.

**Full End-to-End Workflow:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Google Cloud Project:** You must have a Google Cloud project with the required APIs (e.g., Gmail API, Calendar API) enabled.
    *   **OAuth Consent Screen:** Configure the consent screen in your Google Cloud project.
    *   **OAuth 2.0 Client ID:** Create an "OAuth 2.0 Client ID" for a "Web application".
        *   **Authorized JavaScript origins:** Add the URL of your front-end application (e.g., `http://localhost:8081`).
        *   **Authorized redirect URIs:** This is the most critical step. Add the full callback URL of your `mcp-api` host. For example: `http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback`. This must exactly match the URL of the API endpoint that handles the callback.
    *   **Download Credentials:** Download the JSON file containing your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

2.  **API Environment Configuration:**
    *   In the `.env` file for your `mcp-api` instance, create a new variable named `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS`.
    *   The value of this variable should be the **entire content** of the JSON file you downloaded from Google, pasted as a single-line string.

3.  **Install and Configure the MCP Server:**
    *   Use the `POST /packages/install` endpoint to install an OAuth2-capable MCP server (e.g., `mcp-google-workspace`).
    *   In the request body, you **must** include the `env` object to declare the authentication type:
        ```json
        {
          "name": "@missionsquad/mcp-google-workspace",
          "serverName": "mcp-google-workspace",
          "env": {
            "MCP_AUTH_TYPE": "OAUTH2_GOOGLE"
          }
        }
        ```
    *   This `MCP_AUTH_TYPE` variable tells the `mcp-api` that this server requires the special OAuth2 token injection flow.

4.  **Initiate User Authentication (Front-End):**
    *   The front-end application provides a "Connect to Google" button or link for the user.
    *   When clicked, this link should direct the user to the `mcp-api`'s login endpoint, including their unique user ID.
    *   **Example Link:** `http://localhost:8080/auth/google/login?user_id=user123`

5.  **Orchestration (API and Google):**
    *   The `mcp-api` receives the request, calls the `auth_get_authorization_url` tool on the `mcp-google-workspace` server, and redirects the user's browser to the unique URL provided by Google.
    *   The user sees the Google consent screen, reviews the requested permissions, and clicks "Allow".
    *   Google redirects the user's browser back to the `redirect_uri` you configured (`http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback`), including a temporary `authorization_code`.

6.  **Token Exchange and Storage (API):**
    *   The `mcp-api`'s callback endpoint receives the `authorization_code`.
    *   It calls the `auth_exchange_code` tool on the `mcp-google-workspace` server to exchange the code for a long-lived `refresh_token` and a short-lived `access_token`.
    *   The API then securely saves the entire JSON object of these tokens into the encrypted `Secrets` database, associated with `user123` and the `mcp-google-workspace` server.
    *   The user is shown a success message and can close the tab.

7.  **Subsequent Tool Calls (Seamless and Secure):**
    *   From now on, whenever the front-end makes a `POST /mcp/tool/call` request for `user123` to the `mcp-google-workspace` server (e.g., to query emails), the `mcp-api` automatically:
        1.  Recognizes that this server requires `OAUTH2_GOOGLE` auth.
        2.  Retrieves the user's encrypted tokens from the `Secrets` database.
        3.  Retrieves the global application credentials from the `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
        4.  Injects both sets of credentials as hidden parameters into the tool call.
    *   The `mcp-google-workspace` server receives these credentials, creates a temporary authenticated client, and executes the tool. The front-end never handles any tokens.

## Security Considerations

- The `SECRETS_KEY` environment variable is used to encrypt all secrets. Keep this secure and unique for each deployment.
- Use HTTPS in production to protect data in transit.
- Consider implementing additional authentication mechanisms for the API endpoints.
- Regularly rotate encryption keys and update stored secrets.

## Adapting MCP Servers

Some MCP servers may need modification to work with this API:

1. Remove hardcoded environment variable references for secrets
2. Update to accept secrets as parameters to tool methods
3. Ensure tools properly validate required parameters
