# Session: MCP Server Copy - 2025-03-23_23-32-09

## Status
- In Progress

## Summary of Work Done
- Initial planning session for the MCP Server Copy feature
- Analyzed the current MCP server implementation
- Identified key components that need to be modified
- Created a detailed plan for implementing the MCP Server Copy feature
- Discussed and resolved key design decisions:
  - Secret management: Copies will share secrets with the original server
  - Version updates: When original server updates, we'll validate and clean up allowedMethods in copies
  - Copy restrictions: Only allow copies of original servers, not copies of copies
  - Method-specific environment variables: Not needed for this implementation

## Next Steps
- Implement the MCPServer interface changes to add isServerCopy, originalServerName, and allowedMethods properties
- Develop the createServerCopy, updateServerCopyMethods, and deleteServerCopy methods in MCPService
- Modify the callTool method to handle server copies by:
  - Checking if the server is a copy
  - Validating the requested method is in the allowedMethods list
  - Retrieving secrets from the original server
  - Forwarding the call to the original server's connection
- Add new API endpoints for managing server copies
- Implement validation and cleanup logic for method lists during server updates
- Update documentation

## Code Changes (Summary)
- No code changes yet, this is the initial planning session

## Open Questions/Problems Encountered
- How to handle secret management for copied servers? **Resolved**: Copies will share secrets with the original server
- Should copied servers share the same package installation? **Resolved**: Yes, copies will use the same package installation
- How to handle version updates to the original server? **Resolved**: Validate and clean up allowedMethods in copies
- Should we allow copies of copies? **Resolved**: No, only copies of original servers
- Should we add method-specific environment variables? **Resolved**: No, not needed for this implementation

## AI Assistance Notes
- Model Used: Claude
- Prompt: "let's start a new session and plan how to add feature that will enable making a copy of a mcp server, but not actually install a duplicate package - it would use the same installation of the mcp server, and the purpose of this copy is to only only expose specified methods from that server. for example, if we have a server with 10 tools, we want to be able to specify 3 of them to use."
