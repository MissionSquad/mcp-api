## Code Changes (Summary)
- Updated the `PackageInfo` interface in `src/services/packages.ts` to include latest version information, update availability, and last upgraded date
- Added 'upgrading' status to the existing status enum
- Implemented the `compareVersions` utility function in `src/utils/general.ts` for semantic version comparison
- Implemented core service methods in `PackageService`:
  - `checkForUpdates` method to check for available updates
  - `upgradePackage` method to upgrade a specific package
  - `upgradeAllPackages` method to upgrade all packages
- Added new endpoints to `PackagesController`:
  - `GET /packages/updates` for checking available updates
  - `PUT /packages/:name/upgrade` for upgrading a specific package
  - `PUT /packages/upgrade-all` for upgrading all packages
- Updated existing endpoints to include version information:
  - Updated `GET /packages` to include version information and support update checking
  - Updated `GET /packages/by-name/:name` and `GET /packages/by-id/:name` to include version information and support update checking
- Added unit tests for the `compareVersions` utility function in `test/utils.spec.ts`
- Updated API documentation in README.md to include new package upgrade endpoints
- Created usage examples for the package upgrade feature

## Open Questions/Problems Encountered
- Need to determine the best approach for handling dependencies that might change between versions
- Need to decide if a more robust rollback mechanism for failed upgrades should be implemented in the future
- Need to consider how to handle breaking changes in newer versions
- Need to determine the best approach for testing with real packages
