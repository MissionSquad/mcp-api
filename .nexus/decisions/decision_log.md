# Decision Log

## [Current Date] - Initial Project Setup

- **Context:** Starting the project.
- **Decision:** Adopted the Nexus System.
- **Rationale:** Improve communication, knowledge retention, and context management.
- **Alternatives Considered:** None (at this stage).
- **Consequences:** Requires adherence to Nexus System.

## 2025-03-23 - Package Upgrade Feature Implementation

- **Context:** Currently, the MCP API supports installing, uninstalling, enabling, and disabling packages, but there is no way to upgrade packages to newer versions once they are installed.
- **Decision:** Implement a package upgrade feature that allows upgrading all packages to latest versions, upgrading specific packages to latest or specified versions, and including version information in package endpoints.
- **Rationale:** This feature will improve the maintainability of the system by allowing users to keep their packages up to date with the latest bug fixes and features.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Manual uninstall and reinstall process (rejected due to poor user experience)
  - Automatic updates (rejected due to potential breaking changes)
- **Consequences:** 
  - Requires careful handling of package dependencies
  - May need to implement rollback mechanisms for failed upgrades
  - Will need to handle potential breaking changes in newer versions
